### My Professional Experience 
<p align="left">
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karina-zubko/">LinkedIn</a>
  <p>For the past 2.5 years I have been working with the data in Casafari. I was able to get much experience in whole data life cycle, Market Research, SWOT analysis, dashboard creation, public business presentation, and business communication. Much of my work was centered around working with information to find critical cases that allow us to get new opportunities or avoid pitfalls.</p>

### [Tableau Dashboard: Amazon Prime Video](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karyna5596/viz/AmazonPrimeVideo_16910027884160/Dashboard1)


<p>
The data visualized using Tableau shows us the main information about the sales process in 4 regions. You can easily switch the region and work with the data brought to it. The following calculations were applied:
  
<br> 1. <em> Understanding what content is available in different countries.
<br>
2. <em> Identifying similar content by matching text-based features
<br>
3. <em> Actors / Directors</em> and find interesting insights
<br>
4. Does <em> Amazon Prime</em> have more focus on TV Shows than movies in recent years?
</p>

### [AirBnb. Price prediction model for apartment in Lisbon](https://github.com/KarinaZubko/Portfolio/tree/main/AirBnb%20Price%20Prediction)


<p>
This project analyzed the factors that may have significant roles in affecting prices, which will provide comprehensive insights about Airbnb rental price valuation across the Lisbon area.
<p>
The prices and all info about listings I took from opensource
  <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/"> InsideAirBn </a> 
    website. For modeling, I used Linear Regression and Multiple Regression.
<p> <em>Ploty, MatplotLib, Seaborn, Missingno, HeatMap, NumPy, SKLearn</em>

The analysis consists of:

<br> 1. Data Cleaning
<br> 2. EDA
<br> 3. Correlation
<br> 4. Clusterization
<br> 5. Check numeric field distribution
<br> 6. Top Listing count
<br> 7. Map Visualization (Based on Listings & Based on prices)
<br> 8. Modeling (Linear Regression & Multiple Regression)
</p>

### [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://github.com/KarinaZubko/Portfolio/blob/main/NLP/NLP_Twitter_spam_amalysis.ipynb)


<p>
Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets. Predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. 
Completed in terms of Kaggle Competition.
<p>
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programmatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). During the learning, I have been challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones aren’t.
<p> <em>Ploty, NLP, NLTK, MatplotLib, NumPy, SKLearn, Keras</em>

The analysis consists of:

<br> 1. Libraries Import
<br> 2. Dataset Import
<br> 3. Cleaning and filling in missing data
<br> 4. Dataset Visualisation
<br> 5. Vecotisation
<br> 6. Modeling
<br> 7. Long-short time memory networks
<br> 8. Practical case: Dissaster Tweets

### [Coaster EDA](https://github.com/KarinaZubko/Portfolio/blob/main/Coaster_EDA/EDA.ipynb)


<p>
Exploratory Data Analysis is a necessary tool for any data scientist. The analysis ran using <em>pandas&numpy</em> packages, <em>matplotlib</em>  visualization library and <em>seaborn</em> package for plots creation. The analysis consists of:

<br> 1. Data Understanding
<br> 2. Data Preparation
<br> 3. Plotting Feature Distributions
<br> 4. Feature Relationships
<br> 5. Data Insight

### [Tableau Dashboard: Sales Tracking by Regions](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karyna5596/viz/SalesTrackinngbyRegions/Dashboard1?publish=yes)


<p>
The data visualized using Tableau shows us the main information about the sales process in 4 regions. You can easily switch the region and work with the data brings to it. The following calculations were applied:
  
<br> 1. <em> Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Orders, Turn Over percentage </em> for the current year + <em> % of Changes</em> compared with the previous year.
<br>
2. <em>Daily number of Sales deals</em> for selected region
<br>
3. <em> Top 5 categories of Sales</em> for selected region
<br>
4. <em> Order Details with profit and sales calculations</em> for selected region
