### [Looker Dashboard: Ultra Marathon Finishers](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/e5837fa5-1b7f-4136-a3af-a0d339000e15/page/ikM3D)

<em> 
This project showcases a comprehensive Data Analyst portfolio that leverages a variety of tools including Excel, Python, SQL, and Looker. The primary objective is to download, clean, and visualize data related to an ultra marathon event, providing valuable insights through detailed analysis and graphical representations.

 
<br> Project Workflow: 

<br> <strong> 1. Data Collection </strong>: Downloading the marathon data from online sources.
<br> <strong> 2. Data Cleaning : </strong>Utilizing Python and Excel to clean and preprocess the data, addressing issues such as missing values, incorrect data entries, and ensuring data consistency.
<br> <strong> 3. Data Analysis: </strong>Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python ([Link to Python Code](https://github.com/KarinaZubko/Portfolio/blob/main/Marathon/Marathon_Results.ipynb)) and SQL ([Link to SQL queries](https://github.com/KarinaZubko/Portfolio/blob/main/Marathon/Marathon_SQL.sql)) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the dataset.
<br> <strong> 4. Data Visualization: </strong>Creating comprehensive visualizations using Looker to illustrate key findings and make the data more accessible and understandable.
<br> <strong> 5. Reporting: </strong>Compiling the analysis and visualizations into a coherent report or dashboard that highlights the main insights and conclusions from the study.

<br> Conclusion:

This project not only demonstrates the technical skills required for data analysis but also provides practical insights into ultra marathon performance. Stay tuned for the subsequent project on the 100-mile ultra marathon, where even more in-depth analysis will be conducted.

<br> Key Skills:

Data cleaning and preprocessing, 
Data analysis and manipulation,
SQL querying,
Data visualization,
Dashboard creation.

### [Tableau Dashboard: Amazon Prime Video](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karyna5596/viz/AmazonPrimeVideo_16910027884160/Dashboard1)


<em> 
The data visualized using Tableau shows us the main information about the sales process in 4 regions. You can easily switch the region and work with the data brought to it. The following calculations were applied:
<em> 
  
<br> 1. <em> Understanding what content is available in different countries.
<br>
2. <em> Identifying similar content by matching text-based features
<br>
3. <em> Actors / Directors</em> and find interesting insights
<br>
4. Does <em> Amazon Prime</em> have more focus on TV Shows than movies in recent years?

### [AirBnb. Price prediction model for apartment in Lisbon](https://github.com/KarinaZubko/Portfolio/tree/main/AirBnb%20Price%20Prediction)


<p>
This project analyzed the factors that may have significant roles in affecting prices, which will provide comprehensive insights about Airbnb rental price valuation across the Lisbon area.
<p>
The prices and all info about listings I took from opensource
  <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/"> InsideAirBn </a> 
    website. For modeling, I used Linear Regression and Multiple Regression.
<p> <em>Ploty, MatplotLib, Seaborn, Missingno, HeatMap, NumPy, SKLearn</em>

The analysis consists of:

<br> 1. Data Cleaning
<br> 2. EDA
<br> 3. Correlation
<br> 4. Clusterization
<br> 5. Check numeric field distribution
<br> 6. Top Listing count
<br> 7. Map Visualization (Based on Listings & Based on prices)
<br> 8. Modeling (Linear Regression & Multiple Regression)

### [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://github.com/KarinaZubko/Portfolio/blob/main/NLP/NLP_Twitter_spam_amalysis.ipynb)


<p>
Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets. Predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. 
Completed in terms of Kaggle Competition.
<p>
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programmatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). During the learning, I have been challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones aren’t.
<p> <em>Ploty, NLP, NLTK, MatplotLib, NumPy, SKLearn, Keras</em>

The analysis consists of:

<br> 1. Libraries Import
<br> 2. Dataset Import
<br> 3. Cleaning and filling in missing data
<br> 4. Dataset Visualisation
<br> 5. Vecotisation
<br> 6. Modeling
<br> 7. Long-short time memory networks
<br> 8. Practical case: Dissaster Tweets
