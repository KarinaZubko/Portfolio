<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karina-zubko/"><img src="images/LN_header.png"></a></p>
  
  <p>For the past 2 years I have been working with the data in Casafari. I was able to get much experience in all data life-cycle, Market Research, SWOT analysis, dashboard creation, public business presentation, and business communication. Much of my work was centered around working with information to find critical cases that allow us to get new opportunities or avoid pitfalls.</p>

### [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://github.com/KarinaZubko/Portfolio/blob/main/NLP/NLP_Twitter_spam_amalysis.ipynb)


<p>
Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets. Predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. 
Completed in terms of Kaggle Competition.
<p>
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies). During the learcing, I have been challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.
<p> <em>Ploty, NLP, NLTK, MatplotLib, NumPy, SKLearn, Keras</em>

The analysis consists of:

<br> 1. Libraries Import
<br> 2. Dataset Import
<br> 3. Cleaning and filling in missing data
<br> 4. Dataset Visualisation
<br> 5. Vecotisation
<br> 6. Modeling
<br> 7. Long-short time memory networks
<br> 8. Practical case: Dissaster Tweets

### [Coaster EDA](https://github.com/KarinaZubko/Portfolio/blob/main/Coaster_EDA/EDA.ipynb)


<p>
Exploratory Data Analysis it a necessary tool for any data scientist. The analysis run using <em>pandas&numpy</em> packages, <em>matplotlib</em>  visualisation library and <em>seaborn</em> package for plots creation. The analysis consists of:

<br> 1. Data Understanding
<br> 2. Data Preparation
<br> 3. Plotting Feature Distributions
<br> 4. Feature Relationships
<br> 5. Data Insight

### [Tableau Dashboard: Sales Tracking by Regions](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karyna5596/viz/SalesTrackinngbyRegions/Dashboard1?publish=yes)


<p>
The data visualized using Tableau show us the main information about sales process in 4 regions. You can easily switch the region and work with the data brings to it. The following calculations were applied:
  
<br> 1. <em> Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Orders, Turn Over percentage </em> for the current year + <em> % of Changes</em> compared with the previous year.
<br>
2. <em>Daily number of Sales deals</em> for selected region
<br>
3. <em> Top 5 categories of Sales</em> for selected region
<br>
4. <em> Order Details with profit and sales calculations</em> for selected region

### [Employee Exhaustion Analysis](https://github.com/KarinaZubko/Portfolio/blob/main/Employee%20Exhaustion%20Analysis/Employee_Exhaustion_Analysis_using_ML.ipynb)


<p>
In this project, machine learning and deep learning algorithms are used to predict employee attrition. The following steps were taken:
  
<br>1. Including necessary libraries and importing datasets.
<br>2. Exploratory Data Analysis
<br>3. Data Splitting
<br>4. Data Modeling

### [E-Commerce Shipping Prediction](https://github.com/KarinaZubko/Portfolio/blob/main/E_Commerce_Shipping/Prediction.ipynb)


<p>
This shipment tracking data will instantly answer the next questions:

<br> 1 - What was the customer rating? Was the product delivered on time?
<br> 2 - Does it respond to the customer's request?
<br> 3 - If the importance of the product is high, does it have the highest rating, was it delivered on time?
